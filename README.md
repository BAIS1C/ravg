Understood. I will analyze the feasibility of a hybrid Image Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for video generation that prioritizes character consistency across frames while maintaining spatial and compositional coherence. The research will focus on:

- Evaluating existing open-source models (WAN2.1, SkyeReels, Hunyuan, Teachace, etc.) and their capacity for retrieval-augmented video generation.
- Identifying necessary modifications or extensions to these models or ComfyUI workflows to enable this functionality.
- Examining how retrieval caching, memory mechanisms, and latent diffusion techniques can be integrated for stable character embeddings across frames.
- Exploring the role of Riflex interpolation for extended video length.
- Determining whether a new model class and custom nodes are required to achieve this or if existing architectures can be adapted.
- Proposing a high-level architecture for a next-gen retrieval-augmented video generation framework optimized for character-consistent, multi-shot video production within home hardware constraints (24GB VRAM, max resolution limits).

I will report back with a detailed analysis of feasibility, required developments, and a recommended path forward.

# Evaluation of Existing Video Generation Models and Consistency Challenges

**WAN2.1 (Alibaba)** – *Tongyi Wanxiang 2.1* is a state-of-the-art open-source text-to-video model (14B and 1.3B parameters) known for high-quality output ([Alibaba Cloud Open Sources its AI Models for Video Generation - Alibaba Cloud Community](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-open-sources-its-ai-models-for-video-generation_602025#:~:text=%2A%20Alibaba%20Cloud%20open,model%20among%20the%20top%20five)) ([Alibaba Cloud Open Sources its AI Models for Video Generation - Alibaba Cloud Community](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-open-sources-its-ai-models-for-video-generation_602025#:~:text=generating%20realistic%20visuals%20by%20accurately,VBench%20leaderboard%20of%20Hugging%20Face)). It excels in realistic motion and complex scenes, topping benchmarks like VBench in dynamics, spatial relations, and multi-object interactions ([Alibaba Cloud Open Sources its AI Models for Video Generation - Alibaba Cloud Community](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-open-sources-its-ai-models-for-video-generation_602025#:~:text=generating%20realistic%20visuals%20by%20accurately,VBench%20leaderboard%20of%20Hugging%20Face)). In practice, Wan2.1 produces smooth, coherent short clips with good object permanence – e.g. it maintains lighting and color consistency throughout a sequence ([MimicPC - Wan2.1 vs SkyReels+Hunyuan: Which Video Model Wins?](https://www.mimicpc.com/learn/wan-vs-skyreels-hunyuan-which-image-to-video-model-win#:~:text=Wan2,color%20fidelity%20throughout%20the%20sequence)). It also handles multiple elements without confusion; evaluations note **“higher consistency in complex multi-object scenes”** as a strength ([MimicPC - Wan2.1 vs SkyReels+Hunyuan: Which Video Model Wins?](https://www.mimicpc.com/learn/wan-vs-skyreels-hunyuan-which-image-to-video-model-win#:~:text=Wan2)). However, like other diffusion-based video models, **Wan2.1 can still suffer from *appearance drift*** over longer durations. Without explicit memory, a character’s look may subtly change or degrade frame-to-frame ([[2412.06016] Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06016#:~:text=,to%20existing%20video%20generation%20architectures)). Its strong performance partly mitigates this for a few seconds, but identity consistency is not guaranteed for extended or multi-shot videos. On the hardware side, the smaller 1.3B variant of Wan2.1 balances quality and compute, enabling use on consumer GPUs ([Alibaba Cloud Open Sources its AI Models for Video Generation - Alibaba Cloud Community](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-open-sources-its-ai-models-for-video-generation_602025#:~:text=The%20T2V,little%20as%20around%204%20minutes)). For example, a ~5-second 480p clip can be generated in minutes on a standard PC ([Alibaba Cloud Open Sources its AI Models for Video Generation - Alibaba Cloud Community](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-open-sources-its-ai-models-for-video-generation_602025#:~:text=The%20T2V,little%20as%20around%204%20minutes)). Thus Wan2.1 provides a solid foundation, but would need augmentation to reliably preserve specific character identities beyond its inherent diffusion coherence.

**Hunyuan and SkyReels** – *HunyuanVideo* (Tencent’s 13B-param model) and its fine-tune **SkyReels V1** represent another open-source avenue. HunyuanVideo achieves very high visual quality and motion stability ([Hunyuan Video | Text to Video | AI Playground - Fal.ai](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/hunyuan-video#:~:text=Hunyuan%20Video%20is%20an%20Open,video%20alignment%2C%20and%20generation%20stability)) ([HunyuanVideo-I2V: A Customizable Image-to-Video Model ... - GitHub](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo-I2V#:~:text=GitHub%20github,using%20a%20GPU%20with)), but at a heavy compute cost (60+GB VRAM for 720p generation) making it less accessible for home use ([HunyuanVideo-I2V: A Customizable Image-to-Video Model ... - GitHub](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo-I2V#:~:text=GitHub%20github,using%20a%20GPU%20with)). **SkyReels V1**, on the other hand, is a HunyuanVideo model fine-tuned on ~10 million human-centric clips ([Skywork/SkyReels-V1-Hunyuan-I2V - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/SkyReels-V1-Hunyuan-I2V#:~:text=Skywork%2FSkyReels,10M%29%20high)) to improve rendering of characters. SkyReels focuses on **consistent human appearance and emotional expression**: it produces nuanced, expressive faces and more cinematic styling ([MimicPC - Wan2.1 vs SkyReels+Hunyuan: Which Video Model Wins?](https://www.mimicpc.com/learn/wan-vs-skyreels-hunyuan-which-image-to-video-model-win#:~:text=SkyReels%2BHunyuan%20Strengths%3A)). In comparisons, SkyReels+Hunyuan showed superior facial animation quality (capturing subtle expressions), albeit sometimes at the expense of fine object accuracy (e.g. imperfect hand-key alignment in tests) ([MimicPC - Wan2.1 vs SkyReels+Hunyuan: Which Video Model Wins?](https://www.mimicpc.com/learn/wan-vs-skyreels-hunyuan-which-image-to-video-model-win#:~:text=While%20SkyReels%2BHunyuan%20struggles%20with%20accurate,the%20actual%20piano%20playing%20mechanics)). Wan2.1, by contrast, was better at physics and precise details but slightly less vivid in facial emotions ([MimicPC - Wan2.1 vs SkyReels+Hunyuan: Which Video Model Wins?](https://www.mimicpc.com/learn/wan-vs-skyreels-hunyuan-which-image-to-video-model-win#:~:text=Wan2,color%20fidelity%20throughout%20the%20sequence)) ([MimicPC - Wan2.1 vs SkyReels+Hunyuan: Which Video Model Wins?](https://www.mimicpc.com/learn/wan-vs-skyreels-hunyuan-which-image-to-video-model-win#:~:text=While%20SkyReels%2BHunyuan%20struggles%20with%20accurate,the%20actual%20piano%20playing%20mechanics)). Importantly, both models are capable of maintaining a single character over a short clip. SkyReels’ human specialization suggests it tries to preserve the identity/face across frames more strongly. Users have demonstrated ~4-second videos (97 frames at 544×960) on a single RTX 4090 (~24 GB VRAM) using SkyReels, with ~18.5 GB peak usage ([SkyReels-V1-Hunyuan-I2V - a fine-tuned HunyuanVideo that enables I2V generation : r/StableDiffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1iry5pl/skyreelsv1hunyuani2v_a_finetuned_hunyuanvideo/#:~:text=,adding%20GPUs%20greatly%20reduces%20time)). This shows that **high-quality diffusion video generation is feasible on home hardware** given resolution/frame limits. Still, neither Hunyuan nor SkyReels inherently “remember” a character beyond the frames they generate in one go – they do not yet include an explicit retrieval-based memory. Consistency is achieved by the model’s training on human footage, not by caching any embeddings during generation. Thus, out-of-the-box they can struggle if you need the *same* character to reappear in different scenes or longer sequences.

**Other Relevant Models** – Several open research projects address video consistency in creative ways. Notably, **Animate-A-Story** (by VideoCrafter) introduces retrieval augmentation for storytelling videos. It retrieves real video clips to guide motion, then uses a diffusion model to **“synthesize a coherent storytelling video by customizing their appearances”** ([[2307.06940] Animate-A-Story: Storytelling with Retrieval-Augmented Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06940#:~:text=complex%20process%20that%20typically%20requires,shelf%20video%20retrieval%20system%20and)). The process involves a *Motion Structure Retrieval* module (grabbing depth/motion from similar videos) and a *Structure-Guided Synthesis* module to generate new content following that structure ([[2307.06940] Animate-A-Story: Storytelling with Retrieval-Augmented Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06940#:~:text=abundance%20of%20existing%20video%20clips,by%20following%20the%20structural%20guidance)). For character consistency across scenes, Animate-A-Story uses **“concept personalization”** – essentially injecting a custom token or embedding representing the desired character into the prompts ([[2307.06940] Animate-A-Story: Storytelling with Retrieval-Augmented Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06940#:~:text=the%20first%20module%2C%20we%20leverage,advantages%20over%20various%20existing%20baselines)). This keeps the protagonist’s identity stable throughout multiple clips. While this system isn’t a single pre-trained model (it’s a pipeline built on a base text-to-video diffuser), it exemplifies how retrieval and personalized embeddings can preserve characters ([[2307.06940] Animate-A-Story: Storytelling with Retrieval-Augmented Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06940#:~:text=the%20first%20module%2C%20we%20leverage,advantages%20over%20various%20existing%20baselines)). Another recent approach is **Track4Gen**, which tackles temporal drift by training the model with point-tracking supervision ([[2412.06016] Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06016#:~:text=output%2C%20they%20still%20struggle%20with,Track4Gen%20demonstrates%20that%20it%20is)). Track4Gen adds an explicit constraint to follow points across frames, significantly reducing the issue of objects morphing or disappearing over time ([[2412.06016] Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06016#:~:text=video%20generator%20that%20combines%20video,page%3A%20%2017%20this%20http)). This required minimal architectural change to a Stable Diffusion-based video model, but did need a custom training loop ([[2412.06016] Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06016#:~:text=hypothesize%20that%20this%20is%20because,extensive%20evaluations%20show%20that%20Track4Gen)). It demonstrates that *appearance drift* – where a character’s features slowly change – can be addressed by additional training signals ([[2412.06016] Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06016#:~:text=,to%20existing%20video%20generation%20architectures)). In summary, current open-source video generators produce impressively coherent short videos, but **they still rely on implicit consistency** from the diffusion process. As the literature shows, maintaining a character’s exact look across many frames or scene changes remains challenging without adding new mechanisms (personalized embeddings, tracking loss, etc.). These models provide a strong starting point, and their limitations highlight where retrieval-augmented techniques could enhance consistency.

# Modification and Integration Feasibility for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

To ensure persistent characters and scenes, we can extend the above models (or their Stable Diffusion backbones) with **structured retrieval caching and memory mechanisms**. The idea is to supply the generator with references from previous frames or design assets, so it “remembers” what key elements should look like. Several modifications and integrations appear feasible within a ComfyUI or similar workflow:

- **Structured Retrieval Cache**: We can introduce a cache to store **key frame outputs or embeddings** for important elements (characters, objects, backgrounds). For example, when a main character is first generated, we save their **latent embedding or an identity descriptor**. This cache would be structured (indexed per character or scene) so that at any later frame requiring that character, the system retrieves the stored representation. In practice, this could mean saving the character’s reference image (or a processed feature vector) and reusing it as input conditioning for subsequent frames. ComfyUI pipelines can be extended with custom nodes that fetch these cached images/latents and feed them into the next generation step. By always referring back to a consistent reference, we stabilize the character’s appearance. This approach echoes the *concept personalization* in Animate-A-Story ([[2307.06940] Animate-A-Story: Storytelling with Retrieval-Augmented Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06940#:~:text=the%20first%20module%2C%20we%20leverage,advantages%20over%20various%20existing%20baselines)) – essentially giving the diffusion model a fixed “identity” token or image to condition on whenever that character is present.

- **Stable Character Embeddings**: One practical way to implement the above is via **embedding preservation techniques**. Instead of relying only on text prompts like “a knight in armor” (which could yield varying armor styles each time), we attach a learned embedding that encapsulates the exact look of **that** knight. Tools from the Stable Diffusion ecosystem like textual inversion or LoRA fine-tuning can produce such an embedding, but those typically require training. For a more on-the-fly solution, we can use modules like **IP-Adapter and InstantID** to extract a character’s identity embedding from an image. IP-Adapter is a model that takes a reference image and produces an identity code that can guide Stable Diffusion generation ([Create Consistent Characters within ComfyUI](https://www.runcomfy.com/comfyui-workflows/create-consistent-characters-within-comfyui#:~:text=2)). In a ComfyUI workflow, one could supply the first appearance frame of a character into an IP-Adapter node, which **“extracts the facial features and other important details from the input image”** ([Create Consistent Characters within ComfyUI](https://www.runcomfy.com/comfyui-workflows/create-consistent-characters-within-comfyui#:~:text=2)). This yields a latent representation (an “Instant ID”) of the character’s face. We then feed this representation into the diffusion model for all subsequent frames (for that character) to enforce consistency. Essentially, the diffusion model at each timestep gets an extra conditioning vector that says “make the result look like this person’s face” ([Create Consistent Characters within ComfyUI](https://www.runcomfy.com/comfyui-workflows/create-consistent-characters-within-comfyui#:~:text=The%20IPAdapter%2BInstantID%20component%20plays%20a,essence%20of%20the%20original%20input)). By caching that identity vector once, we avoid re-computing it and ensure it remains unchanged. This kind of extension would allow any existing text-to-video model (which usually only takes a text prompt and maybe previous frame) to also take **character identity inputs**, dramatically improving consistency for key actors.

- **Memory of Previous Frames (Temporal Conditioning)**: Besides identity, maintaining *scene coherence* (positions, pose, background continuity) benefits from using information from previous frames. A simple form of memory is **initializing each new frame with the last frame’s image (or latent) as a starting point**. In practice, this can be done with an *image-to-image diffusion* step: for frame *t+1*, provide frame *t* (or its latent) to the model with a small diffusion noise applied. This way, the model doesn’t start from scratch – it refines the last frame toward the new prompt, which naturally preserves most details. This technique has been used in Deforum and other script-based animation loops to get smooth transitions. However, naive carry-over can cause *motion blur* or limit new changes, so it should be balanced with fresh noise. A more controlled approach is to use **ControlNet or similar conditioning on structural cues** from the prior frame. For example, one can extract the depth map or pose keypoints from frame *t* and feed that into frame *t+1* generation so that the basic scene layout and positions carry over. This retains spatial coherence (objects remain in the same places across frames). In a retrieval context, the *retrieved data* for frame *t+1* could simply be frame *t*’s structure. ComfyUI can integrate this by chaining a depth estimation model from each generated frame into a ControlNet for the next frame. By **feeding forward these structural cues**, we achieve a form of temporal memory: the system “remembers” where things were and ensures the next frame doesn’t contradict that (e.g. background objects don’t teleport or change color suddenly).

- **Latent Diffusion Tricks for Temporal Stability**: Since we are constrained to existing architectures, we can’t (without retraining) give Stable Diffusion a true recurrent state. But we can hack around it. One technique is to use correlated noise for all frames so that the diffusion process doesn’t diverge wildly. For instance, initialize the random seed for each frame in a deterministic way or even reuse a portion of the previous frame’s latent noise when generating the next. This encourages the latent features to stay in the same basin, reducing flicker. Another idea is **attentional preservation** – forcing the model to attend to the same token in similar ways across frames. If using a textual prompt with a special token for a character, one could reuse the cross-attention maps from the prior frame’s diffusion process (this is experimental, but researchers have proposed sharing attention for consistency). These low-level tweaks would require custom nodes or code in ComfyUI to carry internal state (e.g. passing the cross-attention tensors, or fixing the noise schedule). While advanced, they hint that *latent-level caching* (not just image-level) can further stabilize generation. In summary, **feasible integrations include**: caching reference images/embeddings, using identity extractors (IP-Adapter) for consistent conditioning, linking frames via image-to-image or ControlNet (depth/pose) to preserve layouts, and reusing noise/latent features to minimize random drift. All of these can be implemented as extensions to current pipelines – leveraging existing model weights but augmenting their input/conditioning interfaces. This means we **don’t have to modify the core model weights**; instead, we build a smarter pipeline around the model to supply it with “memory” in a structured way.

# Leveraging Interpolation for Extended Video Sequences

**Frame interpolation** is a powerful adjunct technique to boost video length and smoothness without increasing generation cost or compromising coherence. By generating only a subset of frames with the diffusion model and using interpolation to fill the gaps, we reduce the chances for the model to introduce inconsistencies. A popular choice is **RIFE (Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation)**, a neural frame interpolation method that can synthesize intermediate frames given two input frames ([RIFE AI interpolation - SmoothVideo Project (SVP) - frame doubling ...](https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/RIFE_AI_interpolation#:~:text=...%20www.svp,the%20intermediate%20flows%20from%20images)). The latest RIFE models (e.g. RIFE 4.x) are efficient and can run in real-time on modern GPUs, even at HD resolutions ([Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation for Video Frame Interpolation](https://github.com/hzwer/ECCV2022-RIFE#:~:text=Interpolation%20github,30%2BFPS%20for%202X%20720p)) ([Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation for Video Frame Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06294#:~:text=Real,with%20the%20temporal%20encoding%20input)).

In a retrieval-augmented workflow, one could generate key frames at a lower frame rate (say 3–6 FPS for a slow-moving scene, or 12 FPS for faster action) using the full diffusion pipeline with all the consistency mechanisms discussed. These key frames already ensure the characters and scenes are as intended. Then, **RIFE interpolation (or “RIFEX”)** would automatically produce the in-between frames to reach a smooth 24 or 30 FPS. Because interpolation uses optical flow-like estimations, it will naturally **preserve the character’s appearance and scene layout** – it’s effectively warping one frame into the next. This avoids the diffusion model potentially adding random new details or errors in those in-between moments. As long as the consecutive key frames are reasonably consistent (which our retrieval-augmented generation ensures), RIFE will create fluid transitions that respect the original look of characters and objects. This means that character features (face, clothing) will morph gradually rather than jump, **eliminating jitter**.

For example, if our character turns her head from frame 1 to frame 5, the diffusion model might generate those two poses, and RIFE can generate frames 2–4 as natural interpolations of that motion. The character stays on-model in every interpolated frame because it’s literally derived from the two consistent key frames. We do need to ensure that the differences between key frames are not drastic – large changes can cause interpolation artifacts or motion blur. In practice, this means generating key frames at a sufficient temporal density for the given action. One strategy is to use the diffusion model for all “important” frames (when a new action starts, or a new expression, etc.) and let interpolation handle only the smoother transitions.

Another benefit of using interpolation is computational: it **extends video length within fixed VRAM and time budgets**. For instance, generating a full 10-second 24 FPS video (240 frames) purely via diffusion is extremely heavy. But generating say 40 frames via diffusion and interpolating 6x (to 240 frames) is far more tractable. This fits well with home hardware limits. The diffusion model sees far fewer steps, and the interpolation model is lightweight. Also, interpolation can be done as a post-process on CPU or a secondary GPU if needed, so it doesn’t hog VRAM during generation. 

In summary, frame interpolation like RIFE serves as a *bridging tool*: it maintains the coherence of motion and appearance by smoothly blending frames, and it allows longer sequences without linearly accumulating generation errors. By integrating RIFE in the pipeline, we **ensure character consistency and scene continuity are maintained between the sparse frames that the diffusion model explicitly renders**. The result is a longer, high-frame-rate video that still looks consistent, achieved without burdening the diffusion model with every tiny transition. This approach complements retrieval-augmented generation: the diffusion model focuses on pivotal frames with retrieval-based consistency, and interpolation fills in the rest, yielding an overall coherent animation.

# New Model vs. Workflow Augmentation: What’s Needed?

Given the above strategies, a key question is whether we must design and train a completely **new model architecture** for retrieval-augmented video generation, or if we can adapt existing models via clever pipeline engineering (nodes, caches, etc.). **Developing a new model from scratch** – for example, a diffusion model with built-in long-term memory – would be very ambitious and resource-intensive. It would involve training a large video diffusion network (likely tens of billions of parameters) with new components (e.g. a retrieval encoder, recurrence or attention across frames) on massive video datasets. This is likely **not feasible on home hardware** and duplicative of existing efforts (Wan2.1, Hunyuan, etc., were trained on huge clusters). Instead, the evidence suggests we can achieve our goals by **augmenting and combining existing open-source components**.

The necessary pieces for character-consistent, multi-shot video are mostly **modular** and can be bolted onto current models:

- **Retrieval Cache & Identity Modules**: We don’t need to bake a retrieval system into the core of the diffusion model; we can implement it externally. For instance, using a vision encoder (like CLIP or a dedicated face encoder) to fetch stored character embeddings is independent of the diffusion model. The diffusion model can then accept that embedding as an additional condition. Many existing architectures already support dual conditioning (e.g. image + text). Stable Diffusion XL, for example, allows an image prompt alongside text. We can exploit such features rather than create a new architecture. In a custom pipeline, a *Character Retrieval Module* can handle looking up the right reference image (or latent) for the current scene and feed it into the model. This behaves like a plugin – something that could be done with a new model, but also can be done by **wrapping a pre-trained model** with pre- and post-processing.

- **Dynamic Memory and Attention**: If we were to build a new model, we might introduce a recurrent layer or long-form transformer attention to allow the model to implicitly remember past frames. But this dramatically increases complexity. An alternative is to simulate this with the pipeline as discussed (passing previous frame info through ControlNet or latent initialization). This effectively gives memory *without* changing the model’s architecture. It’s a form of external memory – the pipeline orchestrator remembers the past and provides the model with the needed context each time. This is analogous to how retrieval-augmented language models work: the base model doesn’t internally store all facts, but at query time an external system provides relevant text. Here, our external system provides relevant visuals (previous frame, key embeddings). Therefore, adapting the *workflow* leverages existing model strengths (great image generation) and mitigates weaknesses (lack of memory) in a more practical way.

- **Embedding/Feature Preservation**: Ensuring the same embedding is used across frames is straightforward if we control the inputs. We can guarantee the same token or vector goes into each frame generation for a given character. In a new model, one might design a special “character token” that persists, but again this can be mimicked by using the same textual inversion embedding or the same reference image each time. The components to do this (textual inversion, LoRA, reference conditioning) already exist in open-source form. It’s more about integration than invention. For example, we could train a small LoRA on a character’s face using a few images. This LoRA (which is a lightweight add-on to the model) can be applied during generation of every frame with virtually no extra VRAM cost, locking the character’s appearance. This avoids training a whole new video model and instead uses a *tiny model extension* on top of Stable Diffusion – very feasible at home.

In light of these points, **building a new model class from scratch is likely unnecessary**. A more efficient path is to **adapt existing architectures** (Wan2.1, SkyReels, etc.) by adding the missing pieces as external modules or minor fine-tunes. The open-source community is already moving in this direction: for instance, SkyReels achieved its human consistency improvements by fine-tuning on more data (not by redesigning the network) ([MimicPC - Wan2.1 vs SkyReels+Hunyuan: Which Video Model Wins?](https://www.mimicpc.com/learn/wan-vs-skyreels-hunyuan-which-image-to-video-model-win#:~:text=SkyReels%2BHunyuan%20Strengths%3A)), and research like Track4Gen achieved temporal stability by a slight modification on top of Stable Diffusion’s architecture ([[2412.06016] Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06016#:~:text=hypothesize%20that%20this%20is%20because,extensive%20evaluations%20show%20that%20Track4Gen)). We can piggyback on these advances. Concretely, one could start with Wan2.1 1.3B (for VRAM efficiency) and implement a **ComfyUI custom workflow** that includes: a retrieval cache node, an identity embedder (IP-Adapter), a ControlNet for temporal structure, and an invocation of RIFE for interpolation. All those components exist separately; our task is to glue them together. This avoids the enormous effort of model training and stays within 24 GB limits by sequentially using modules rather than one monolithic model.

That said, if future development permits, one could envision **training a specialized retrieval-augmented video diffuser** that natively incorporates these ideas (perhaps training with a loss that penalizes deviation from reference embeddings across frames). But as a *feasibility assessment*, the recommended direction is to **prototype with existing open-source parts**. This will clarify which components are most critical and only then inform any new model development if absolutely needed. In summary, an all-new model is not required at this stage – we should treat the problem as a systems integration challenge, leveraging open-source models’ strengths and adding targeted fixes for consistency.

# Proposed Architecture for a Retrieval-Augmented Video Generation System

Bringing it all together, we can outline a **next-gen video generation framework** that achieves character consistency and scene coherence across frames, within the constraints of home hardware. The architecture would be modular, combining retrieval and generation in a staged pipeline:

**1. Story & Scene Planner:** *(**Optional, for multi-shot videos**)* – A high-level module would break the input (e.g. a script or storyboard) into sequences/scenes. This is where one might specify that “Character A appears in Scene 1 and 3, Character B in Scene 2,” etc., along with descriptions of settings. This planner isn’t generation per se, but it informs the retrieval cache which assets will be needed and when. It can also output rough guidance like scene durations or key poses (possibly generated via an LLM or predefined storyboard).

**2. Retrieval Cache & Asset Library:** This is the **memory bank** of the system. It holds reference images, latent embeddings, depth maps, and other descriptors for important entities:
 - For each **character**, the cache stores one or more reference portraits, their textual embedding (if we created a custom token for them), or an identity vector from an IP-Adapter. It may also store segmentation masks of their face/body from a key frame to help isolate the character in generation.
 - For each **location/scene**, the cache can store a representative frame or background plate. For instance, if Scene 1 is a kitchen interior, after generating the first establishing frame, we save that as the canonical background.
 - The cache could also store **object details** (say a unique prop that should persist) in the form of small images or descriptions.
This structured cache can be populated either manually (if the user provides initial designs) or on the fly as the system generates the first instances. The crucial point is that **when generating any new frame, the system will query this cache** for any relevant asset (character or object that should appear). For example, if generating Scene 3 with Character A, it retrieves Character A’s embedding and perhaps a reference image of the outfit they wore in Scene 1.

**3. Frame Generation Module:** This is essentially the **diffusion-based renderer**, orchestrated in a smart way. It would operate either frame-by-frame or shot-by-shot:
 - It takes the **text prompt** for the current frame or scene (e.g. “[Character A] walks into the kitchen, looking surprised.”). The prompt might include placeholder tokens for characters or objects which will be filled in by their personalized embeddings from the cache.
 - It also accepts **conditioning inputs**: these can be retrieved reference images (for character appearance), structural hints (for continuity). For a continuous shot, the previous frame’s data is fed in. For a new shot (e.g. Scene 3 returning to Character A later), the system can retrieve the *last known appearance* of A from Scene 1 as a reference image input.
 - Internally, this module uses a diffusion model (like Wan2.1’s weights or another SD-based video model). We might use a **latent diffusion model** that generates N frames at once (if using a text-to-video model), or we might generate frame-by-frame with an image model. Given home hardware limits, frame-by-frame with reuse might actually be simpler and lighter (generating a few frames at a time to allow interpolation).
 - The **workflow inside** could be a ComfyUI graph where: 
    - An IP-Adapter injects the retrieved character image’s features ([Create Consistent Characters within ComfyUI](https://www.runcomfy.com/comfyui-workflows/create-consistent-characters-within-comfyui#:~:text=2)),
    - A ControlNet takes a depth or pose map (retrieved or from prior frame) to enforce spatial alignment,
    - The text prompt (with fixed tokens for names) goes through the CLIP text encoder,
    - All these conditions are fed into the diffusion sampler to produce the new frame latent, which is decoded to an image.
 - After generation, the **output is analyzed**: we might run a quick face recognition to ensure the character’s face indeed matches the reference (and if not, potentially regenerate the frame with a different seed or stronger conditioning – this is an optional consistency check loop). If the frame is the first of a scene or contains a new pose, we may update the cache (e.g. store a new reference if the character changed outfit).

**4. Temporal Smoothing & Interpolation:** Once key frames or an entire shot’s frames are generated, the **interpolation module (RIFE)** kicks in. If we generated every frame sequentially with tight control, interpolation might only be needed to increase frame rate. But more likely, we generate at a lower FPS and **use RIFE to fill gaps**. This module would take two consecutive generated frames and produce the required number of in-betweens, iteratively building out the full sequence. The result is a high-frame-rate clip where motion is fluid and **characters remain coherent** (since interpolation cannot invent new faces, it morphs whatever was generated, preserving identity). If any blending issues are detected (perhaps blurriness on a face), one could optionally do a quick touch-up by re-running the diffusion model to refine a problematic interpolated frame (using it as init image with low noise, for example).

**5. Multi-Shot Assembly:** For a multi-shot video (different camera angles or scene changes), each shot’s sequence (after interpolation) would be **stitched together** in editing. The retrieval cache ensures that when, say, we cut from Scene 1 to Scene 2 and back to Scene 3, the characters and environment in Scene 3 remain consistent with Scene 1. The system, before rendering Scene 3, will have pulled the cached references from Scene 1. In effect, the architecture treats each scene independently in generation (freeing memory in between if needed), but the *cache carries the continuity across scenes*. This design is crucial for home hardware – by segmenting the video, we never have to generate a very long sequence in one go, avoiding memory blow-up. We load and unload models as needed per scene, and reuse the small reference embeddings to link them.

Throughout this architecture, **efficiency considerations** are made to stay within 24 GB VRAM. The heavy diffusion model is reused for each frame/scene rather than having multiple heavy models resident. Auxiliary models like IP-Adapter, depth estimators, or RIFE are much smaller (or can run on CPU) and are invoked only when needed. For instance, one could load the diffusion model weights once and keep them in VRAM, while streaming frames through with different conditions. The retrieval cache itself is just data (images/vectors) and doesn’t consume significant VRAM except when its outputs are attached to the model. By orchestrating generation in **serial stages (generate → cache → next frame …)**, the peak VRAM is limited to the largest model in use (which is the diffusion model, e.g. ~10–15 GB for 1.3B parameters). Everything else (like reading a reference image from disk, or running a small interpolation network) can be done in between diffusion steps or on alternate hardware.

**In summary,** the proposed framework combines: a) *retrieval of identities and key frames* to enforce consistency, b) *memory of prior frames’ structure* for coherence, c) *high-quality diffusion generation* for the actual imagery, and d) *interpolation and post-processing* for smoothness and extended length. This modular architecture ensures that each aspect of the problem (character looks, scene layout, motion between frames) is handled by a specialized component. By decoupling these, we maintain flexibility and efficiency – e.g. we can dial up the strength of identity conditioning if we notice drift, or adjust interpolation granularity if motion is complex, all without retraining the core generative model.

# Feasibility and Recommended Development Path

From the above assessment, it appears **entirely feasible to build a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for video using open-source tools**. Rather than training a new model from scratch, the recommendation is to prototype using existing models (e.g. Wan2.1 or SkyReels for generation, plus ControlNet, IP-Adapter, etc. for consistency aids). This approach takes advantage of the tremendous visual fidelity these models already offer ([MimicPC - Wan2.1 vs SkyReels+Hunyuan: Which Video Model Wins?](https://www.mimicpc.com/learn/wan-vs-skyreels-hunyuan-which-image-to-video-model-win#:~:text=Wan2)) ([MimicPC - Wan2.1 vs SkyReels+Hunyuan: Which Video Model Wins?](https://www.mimicpc.com/learn/wan-vs-skyreels-hunyuan-which-image-to-video-model-win#:~:text=SkyReels%2BHunyuan%20Strengths%3A)), and remedies their weaknesses via retrieval and caching. Importantly, everything can be done within the constraints of a high-end consumer GPU (24 GB VRAM) by carefully managing resources – as demonstrated by prior uses of these models for ~10 second clips on a 4090 ([SkyReels-V1-Hunyuan-I2V - a fine-tuned HunyuanVideo that enables I2V generation : r/StableDiffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1iry5pl/skyreelsv1hunyuani2v_a_finetuned_hunyuanvideo/#:~:text=,adding%20GPUs%20greatly%20reduces%20time)).

**Key components identified** (retrieval cache, dynamic memory via conditioning, embedding preservation, interpolation) should be the focus of implementation. Each can be developed and tested in isolation: e.g., first confirm that using a fixed reference embedding in stable diffusion yields consistent character over many images; confirm that feeding previous frame depth to ControlNet keeps background arrangement steady; confirm RIFE can interpolate diffused frames without odd artifacts. Once validated, these can be integrated into a unified ComfyUI workflow or a custom pipeline script.

Ultimately, the architecture outlined is a **conceptual design for a “next-gen” video generator** that is within reach now. It leverages the best of both worlds: *generative creativity* from diffusion models and *consistency* from retrieval of known assets. This means we can achieve character-consistent, multi-shot videos (even with costume changes or different angles) by relying on the system to remember and reapply the correct visual cues. The approach is analogous to having a film production crew: the diffusion model is the camera that shoots each frame, while the retrieval cache is the continuity supervisor making sure that the actor’s appearance and the scene details remain the same from shot to shot.

**Recommended next steps** would be to implement this pipeline incrementally. Start by extending an open-source text-to-video model’s pipeline to accept a reference image for a character, and test a simple scene where the same character appears in two separate generated clips – verify the looks match via the reference conditioning. Then add the interpolation step to stretch one of those clips, verifying no new drift is introduced. With those working, one can build out the logic to handle multiple characters and longer stories, using the cache as the glue. If certain aspects prove difficult (e.g. perhaps the base model still changes a costume color slightly), additional fine-tuning or model tweaks (like a LoRA to reinforce the character’s outfit) can be done on the fly.

In conclusion, **extending existing models with retrieval-augmented methods is the viable path**. It avoids the need for exorbitant training and stays within home hardware limits while significantly improving temporal consistency. The technical analysis indicates that each required capability (character memory, scene coherence, frame interpolation) has known solutions that can be integrated. By pursuing this route, we can rapidly develop a powerful video generation framework that maintains high diffusion image quality and yields persistent, story-consistent results across frames – a significant step toward “film-like” AI-generated videos on consumer hardware. The feasibility is high, and the benefits in character consistency and scene flexibility will directly address the current shortcomings of text-to-video models. The marriage of retrieval and generation is a promising direction to **democratize coherent AI video creation** using open-source tools and modest hardware resources.
